# Reading List 
## Command Line App - Kevin Pitzer

### Instructions
run with: ```node reading_list.js```

### Application Objectives
- Type in a query and display a list of 5 books matching that query.
- Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company.
- A user should be able to select a book from the five displayed to save to a “Reading List”
- View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected from their queries -- this is a local reading list and not tied to Google Books’s account features.


## Dependencies
### Babel
Used to allow for the use of ES6 within node. I found this when I was getting
error with using ES6 import/export syntax. Reading up on it, I found that this is
necessary since Node does not support all ES6 updates.
